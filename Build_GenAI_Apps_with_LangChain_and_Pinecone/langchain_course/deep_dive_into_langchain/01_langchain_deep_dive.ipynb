Symptoms typically appear 2 to 21 days after exposure and can include fever, severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and internal and external bleeding. The virus has a high mortality rate, with some outbreaks reporting fatality rates exceeding 90%. Effective prevention strategies include strict infection control measures, safe burial practices, and vaccination efforts, particularly in outbreak regions.\n"

       "Summary: A vector database, vector store or vector search engine is a database that can store vectors (fixed-length lists of numbers) along with other data items. Vector databases typically implement one or more Approximate Nearest Neighbor algorithms, so that one can search the database with a query vector to retrieve the closest matching database records.\n",
       "Vectors are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data, with the number of dimensions ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands, depending on the complexity of the data being represented. A vector's position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, as well as images, audio, and other types of data, can all be vectorized.\n",
       "These feature vectors may be computed from the raw data using machine learning methods such as feature extraction algorithms, word embeddings or deep learning networks. The goal is that semantically similar data items receive feature vectors close to each other.\n",
       "Vector databases can be used for similarity search, semantic search, multi-modal search, recommendations engines, large language models (LLMs), object detection,  etc.\n",
       "Vector databases are also often used to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a method to improve domain-specific responses of large language models. The retrieval component of a RAG can be any search system, but is most often implemented as a vector database. Text documents describing the domain of interest are collected, and for each document or document section, a feature vector (known as an \"embedding\") is computed, typically using a deep learning network, and stored in a vector database. Given a user prompt, the feature vector of the prompt is computed, and the database is queried to retrieve the most relevant documents. These are then automatically added into the context window of the large language model, and the large language model proceeds to create a response to the prompt given this context.\n",

A prompt for a text-to-text language model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat's little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem in the style of Edgar Allan Poe about leaves falling\", or a longer statement including context, instructions, and conversation history.\n",
       "Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"act as a native French speaker\".\n",
       "When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\". Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing, and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic."

OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 and its subsequent popularity caught Google executives off-guard, prompting a sweeping response in the ensuing months. After mobilizing its workforce, the company launched Bard in a limited capacity in March 2023 before expanding to other countries in May. Bard took center stage during the 2023 Google I/O keynote in May and was upgraded to the Gemini LLM in December. In February 2024, Bard and Duet AI, another artificial intelligence product from Google, were unified under the Gemini brand, coinciding with the launch of an Android app.\n",

      "Summary: Kamala Devi Harris was born in Oakland, California, 1964 to biologist Shyamala Gopalan and economist Donald J. Harris. The Harris family moved to various locations in the Midwestern United States from 1966 to 1970, when she moved back to California. At the age of twelve, she moved to Montreal, Quebec, where she attended school through her first year of college.  She then attended Howard University and the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.\n",
      "In her early career, Harris served as Alameda County Deputy District Attorney, then San Francisco County Assistant District Attorney, and then running the Family and Children's Services Division in the San Francisco City Attorney's Office. She then served two terms as District Attorney of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011.\n",

      "Summary: Kamala Harris, the 49th and incumbent vice president of the United States, announced her 2024 campaign for president on July 21, 2024, after incumbent President Joe Biden withdrew his bid for reelection and endorsed her earlier the same day. Harris became the official nominee of the Democratic Party on August 5 following a virtual roll call vote; she selected Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate the following day. Harris is the first nominee who did not participate in the primaries since Vice President Hubert Humphrey in 1968.\n",
      "Harris rose to national prominence in 2016 during her campaign for the United States Senate. She became more widely known when she sought the party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election but withdrew from the race in 2019, citing a lack of funds. She endorsed Joe Biden and was chosen to be his running mate in 2020. After Biden and Harris won the general election, she became the first female vice president of the United States upon her inauguration in 2021.\n",
      "Harris advocates a similar domestic platform to Biden on some issues, supporting national abortion protections, LGBT+ rights, stricter gun control, and legislation to address climate change. She also supports federal cannabis legalization, strengthening voting rights, strengthening the Affordable Care Act, and federal funding of housing. Harris has departed from Biden on economic issues, proposing what has been described as a \"populist\" economic agenda, supporting a ban on grocery and food price gouging, capping prescription drug costs, and expanding the child tax credit. On foreign policy, she supports continued military aid to Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars, but insists that Israel should agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal and work towards a two-state solution. On immigration, Harris supports increasing the number of Border Patrol agents and reforming the immigration system.\n",
      "A presidential debate between Harris and Trump was held on September 10 on ABC, and a vice presidential debate between Walz and Vance was held on October 1 on CBS.\n",

Harris served as the junior senator from California from 2017 to 2021. On August 11, 2020, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden selected her as his running mate in the 2020 United States presidential election, running against incumbent U.S. president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence. With Biden's victory, Harris became vice president.
