The German forces executed a successful penetration that cut off communications between the British and French Armies, leading to a colossal military disaster for the French. The French High Command hoped to close the gap created by the German advance, but the situation deteriorated, and the French Army faced severe challenges, including being outnumbered and surrounded. Ultimately, the French Army was largely cast back and disturbed by the German onslaught.\n"
