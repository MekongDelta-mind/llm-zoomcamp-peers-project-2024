       "[Document(metadata={}, page_content='I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.\\n\\nThe first story is about connecting the dots.\\n\\nI dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?\\n\\nIt started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.\\n\\nAnd 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.\\n\\nIt wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:\\n\\nReed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.\\n\\nNone of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.\\n\\nAgain, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.\\n\\nMy second story is about love and loss.\\n\\nI was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.\\n\\nI really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.\\n\\nI didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\\n\\nDuring the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.\\n\\nI’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.\\n\\nMy third story is about death.\\n\\nWhen I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.\\n\\nRemembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\\n\\nAbout a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.\\n\\nI lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now.\\n\\nThis was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:\\n\\nNo one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.\\n\\nYour time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

       "The paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" presents the Transformer, a groundbreaking neural network architecture that utilizes only attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent and convolutional layers. This design enhances parallelization and reduces training time, leading to superior performance in machine translation, achieving BLEU scores of 28.4 for English-to-German and 41.8 for English-to-French, surpassing previous models. The Transformer consists of an encoder and decoder with stacked self-attention and feed-forward layers, employing techniques like multi-head attention and positional encoding to effectively model dependencies and handle long-range sequences. The architecture demonstrates strong generalization across various tasks, including constituency parsing, and sets new benchmarks in translation efficiency. The study also explores variations in model configurations and their impact on performance, highlighting the potential for future research in applying attention mechanisms to other modalities."

      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: The paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" introduces the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture that relies solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent and convolutional layers. This approach enhances parallelization and reduces training time, allowing the model to achieve state-of-the-art results in machine translation, with a BLEU score of 28.4 for English-to-German and 41.8 for English-to-French. The Transformer demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various tasks, including English constituency parsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of a stack of six identical layers. The encoder features a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network, with residual connections and layer normalization applied to each sub-layer. The decoder includes an additional multi-head attention sub-layer that attends to the encoder's output, with modifications to prevent attending to future positions, ensuring that predictions depend only on known outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key component of the Transformer is the Scaled Dot-Product Attention, which computes attention scores by taking the dot products of queries and keys, scaling them by the square root of their dimension, and applying a softmax function to obtain weights for the values. This method is efficient and effective, particularly when implemented with matrix multiplication. The model employs Multi-Head Attention, which allows it to project queries, keys, and values into multiple learned representations, performing attention in parallel to capture diverse information from different representation subspaces. Specifically, the Transformer uses eight parallel attention heads, each with reduced dimensionality, maintaining computational efficiency while enhancing the model's ability to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer utilizes multi-head attention in three distinct ways: in encoder-decoder attention layers, where the decoder queries attend to the encoder's output; in self-attention layers within the encoder, allowing each position to attend to all previous positions; and in self-attention layers within the decoder, which are masked to prevent leftward information flow, preserving the auto-regressive property.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to attention sub-layers, each layer in the encoder and decoder contains a position-wise feed-forward network, consisting of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. The model also incorporates learned embeddings to convert input and output tokens into vectors, and it uses positional encoding to inject information about the order of the sequence, compensating for the lack of recurrence and convolution. The positional encodings are derived from sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, allowing the model to learn relative positions effectively and potentially extrapolate to longer sequences than those encountered during training.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors emphasize the collaborative effort behind the development and implementation of the Transformer, which represents a significant advancement in the field of sequence transduction. The paper discusses the advantages of self-attention over recurrent and convolutional layers, highlighting its lower computational complexity, greater parallelization potential, and shorter path lengths for learning long-range dependencies, making it particularly suitable for tasks involving variable-length sequences. Additionally, the authors note that self-attention could yield more interpretable models, as individual attention heads learn to perform different tasks and exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The training of the Transformer models was conducted on large datasets, including the WMT 2014 English-German and English-French datasets, utilizing the Adam optimizer with a specific learning rate schedule and regularization techniques such as residual dropout. The training process was optimized for efficiency, leveraging powerful hardware to achieve significant performance improvements. Notably, the Transformer outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, achieving BLEU scores of 28.4 and 41.8, respectively, while requiring significantly less training cost in terms of floating point operations (FLOPs). The authors also employed label smoothing during training to improve accuracy and BLEU scores, further demonstrating the model's effectiveness.\n",

      "Additionally, the paper presents variations on the Transformer architecture, showing that larger models generally yield better performance, while dropout is effective in preventing overfitting. The Transformer also generalizes well to English constituency parsing, achieving competitive results compared to previous models, indicating its versatility across different tasks. The findings suggest that while certain architectural choices, such as the size of attention keys, can impact model quality, the overall design of the Transformer remains robust and effective across various applications. The authors also highlight the model's performance in small-data regimes, noting that it outperforms traditional RNN sequence-to-sequence models even with limited training data, further underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness. Future research directions include extending the Transformer to other modalities beyond text and exploring local attention mechanisms for handling larger inputs and outputs.\n",

       "**Introduction**  \n",
       "The paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" introduces the Transformer model, a groundbreaking architecture that has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) by relying solely on attention mechanisms. This model addresses the shortcomings of traditional recurrent and convolutional networks, resulting in enhanced training efficiency, superior performance, and the ability to effectively manage long-range dependencies in data. The Transformer not only sets new standards for sequence transduction tasks but also opens avenues for future innovations in machine learning. The paper thoroughly explores the components of the Transformer and showcases its effectiveness across various applications, including machine translation and other NLP tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Points:**\n",
       "- **Architecture**: The Transformer consists of an encoder-decoder structure, each with six identical layers utilizing multi-head self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks.\n",
       "- **Multi-Head Attention**: This feature enables the model to focus on different representation subspaces, capturing a diverse range of relationships within the data.\n",
       "- **Attention Mechanism**: The attention function maps queries to key-value pairs, producing outputs as weighted sums based on the compatibility of queries with keys.\n",
       "- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: This method computes dot products of queries and keys, scales them, and applies a softmax function to derive weights, effectively addressing gradient flow issues.\n",
       "- **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**: These techniques improve training stability and overall performance in both encoder and decoder layers.\n",
       "- **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks**: Each layer includes a fully connected feed-forward network, applied independently to each position.\n",
       "- **Positional Encoding**: The model employs positional encodings to maintain sequence order, using sine and cosine functions to learn relative positions.\n",
       "- **Performance**: The Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation, significantly improving BLEU scores and outperforming previous models while reducing training time.\n",
       "- **Efficiency**: The model can be trained in as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs, demonstrating its computational efficiency.\n",
       "- **Versatility**: The Transformer has been successfully applied to various tasks, including English constituency parsing, reading comprehension, and abstractive summarization.\n",
       "- **Self-Attention**: This mechanism enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies, improving performance across diverse tasks.\n",
       "- **Comparative Analysis**: Self-attention layers exhibit lower computational complexity and greater parallelization compared to recurrent and convolutional layers.\n",
       "- **Training Regime**: The models were trained on WMT 2014 datasets, utilizing byte-pair encoding and a shared vocabulary, with a focus on optimization techniques.\n",
       "- **Results**: The Transformer outperforms previous models in BLEU scores for English-to-German and English-to-French translations, achieving these results with lower computational costs.\n",
       "- **Model Variations**: The paper explores variations in the Transformer model, revealing optimal ranges for attention heads and the significance of dropout in preventing overfitting.\n",
       "- **Generalization**: The architecture generalizes well to tasks beyond translation, achieving competitive F1 scores in English constituency parsing.\n",
       "- **Small Data Regimes**: The Transformer shows promising results in small-data scenarios, outperforming traditional RNN models.\n",
       "- **Attention Visualizations**: The paper includes visualizations of the attention mechanism, illustrating how the model captures long-distance dependencies. For example, in the encoder's self-attention layer, attention heads focus on the verb \"making,\" maintaining contextual relevance across distances. Additionally, attention heads in layer 5 demonstrate their role in anaphora resolution, showcasing sharp attentions for the word \"its.\"\n",
       "- **Layer-Specific Behavior**: Attention heads in layer 5 exhibit behavior related to sentence structure, indicating that different heads have learned to perform distinct tasks, further enhancing the model's interpretability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion**  \n",
       "The introduction of the Transformer architecture represents a significant leap forward in neural network design, providing a robust framework for addressing a wide range of sequence transduction challenges. Its innovative attention mechanisms not only enhance performance but also lay the groundwork for future developments in natural language processing and related fields. The ongoing exploration of self-attention and its implications for model interpretability and efficiency underscores the Transformer's potential to shape the future of machine learning."
